> [!NOTE]
> Things to mention: `devcontainer`, `.github`, `husky`, `.run`, `commitlint`, `prettier`, package.json settings, vite config, externalize dependencies, explain why react and react-dom are added as dev dependencies, explain how to configure the IDE (Prettier and Startup services), explain local page and demo page and how to configure GitHub pages. Mentions configure token actions

> [!NOTE]
> Add examples of libraries created using this template. Explain folder structure for lib development. Mention that to create a granular token only for the specific package, it is required to publish manually for the first time `npm publish`. Also, mention that the token should by pass 2FA. Mentions `tsconfig.app.json` option to allow jsx in `dev` folder. Explain `vite-plugin-dts` config.

## Introduction

An efficient image-to-pixel transformation with motion effects, leveraging WebGL's hardware acceleration through [Three.js](https://threejs.org/):

> [!TIP]
> The approach of this implementation bypasses the performance limitations of the 2D canvas API, enabling smooth and dynamic visual effects directly on the GPU.

> [!TIP]
> If you would like to implement a similar effect on a 3D model, you can use the related library [`d3p1/thr2pxl`](https://github.com/d3p1/thr2pxl), which uses [GPGPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_computing_on_graphics_processing_units) to achieve it with high performance.

> [!NOTE]
> This library was inspired by these excellent tutorials:
> - [Three.js Journey - Particle Cursor Animation Shader](https://threejs-journey.com/lessons/particles-cursor-animation-shader).
> - [Learn Creative Coding: Image Effects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeZ1pTg_nMo).
> - [Image into Interactive Particles - HTML Canvas Animation Tutorial | Advanced Pure Vanilla JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afdHgwn1XCY). 


## Installation

You can install this library using a package manager like `npm`:

```javascript
npm install @d3p1/lib-ts-react-template
```

Or you can use a CDN like [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) and this [importmap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/script/type/importmap) in the `<head>` of your `html` file:

```html
<head>
  ...
  <script type="importmap">
    {
      "imports": {
        "@d3p1/lib-ts-react-template": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@d3p1/lib-ts-react-template@<version>/dist/lib-ts-react-template.min.js",
        "three": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@<version>/build/three.module.min.js",
        "tweakpane": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tweakpane@<version>/dist/tweakpane.min.js"
      }
    }
  </script>
  ...
</head>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Remember to replace the `<version>` with the actual version of `lib-ts-react-template` and its peer dependencies ([`three`](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) and [`tweakpane`](https://github.com/cocopon/tweakpane)). To do that, you can check the [`package.json`](https://github.com/d3p1/lib-ts-react-template/blob/main/package.json) of the last release and get required versions from there.

## Usage

Using this library is straightforward:

1. Go to our [builder page](https://d3p1.github.io/lib-ts-react-template/) and make the desired customizations in the tweak panel to achieve the desired effect.

2. Use the `Copy` button to obtain the configuration that produces the desired effect.

3. Instantiate the library with the configuration copied in the previous step, for example:

```javascript
import Img2Pxl from '@d3p1/lib-ts-react-template'

new Img2Pxl({
  images: {
    0: {
      src: <image-src>,
      width: <image-width>,
      height: <image-height>,
      resolution: {
        width: <image-resolution-width>,
        height: <image-resolution-height>
      },
      pixel: {
        size: 2,
        alphaTest: 0.9,
        motion: {
          displacement: {
            frequency: 1,
            amplitude: 40,
          },
        },
      },
      motion: {
        noise: {
          frequency: 0.025,
          amplitude: 40,
        },
      },
    },
  },
  pointer: {
    size: 0.1,
    trailing: {
      factor: 0.01
    }
  }
})
```
